# Interactive-Butler-Volmer-Equation-Plots-with-ipywidgets
This repository contains a collection of interactive plots for visualizing the Butler-Volmer equation using ipywidgets. The Butler-Volmer equation is a fundamental equation in electrochemistry, describing the relationship between the current density and the overpotential in an electrochemical reaction.These interactive plots allow you to explore the behavior of the Butler-Volmer equation for different values of transfer coefficient. You can use these plots to gain a better understanding of how transfer coefficient affect the current-voltage characteristics of an electrochemical system.

### Note: In order to play with transfer coefficient and see its effect on current density please download the code file and run on your machine or at google colab.
